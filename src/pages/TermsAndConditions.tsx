          These terms and conditions ("Agreement") set forth the general terms
          and conditions of your use of the Screbbi website ("Website" or
          "Service") and any related products and services (collectively,
          "Services"). This Agreement is legally binding between you ("User",
          "you" or "your") and the Website operator ("Operator", "we", "us" or
          "our"). By accessing and using the Website and Services, you
          acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by
          the terms of this Agreement. If you are entering into this Agreement
          on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you
          have the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement, and in that
          case, the terms "User", "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity. If
          you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms
          of this Agreement, you must not accept this Agreement and may not
          access and use the Website and Services. You acknowledge that this
          Agreement is a contract between you and the Operator, even though it
          is electronic and not physically signed by you, and it governs your
          use of the Website and Services.

          information of any kind may result in the termination of your account.
          You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account
          or any other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts
          or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a
          result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete
          your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have
          violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or
          content would damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your
          account for these reasons, you may not reregister for our Services. We
          may block your email address and IP address to prevent further
          registration.

        <div className="terms-title">Credit Allocation and Use</div>
        <div className="terms-text">
          You will receive a specific monthly credit allocation based on your
          chosen subscription plan tier. Credits will be added to your account
          each month on the Credit Renewal Date, which aligns with your original
          subscription date. Credits are for use with services and features
          within your subscription. Credits have no cash value and are
          non-transferable. Unused monthly credits will expire on your Credit
          Renewal Date. If your plan includes a credit rollover provision,
          unused credits can be retained as long as you are an active
          subscriber, but they will expire after twelve (12) months. Additional
          credits can be purchased and will remain available until used. All
          credits require an active subscription for use.

          Your subscription to the Website and Services will automatically renew
          each month. You may cancel your subscription at any time via the
          account membership page or by emailing us at the address provided
          below. Due to the nature of digital services, we do not offer refunds
          on cancellations. If you downgrade to a lower-tier plan, you will
          retain access to your previous plan until your renewal date. If you
          upgrade to a higher-tier plan, you will receive a pro-rated refund for
          unused time on your previous plan when charged for your new plan.
